# WumpusQuest

## Overview

**WumpusQuest** is a simulation of an intelligent agent navigating the perilous Wumpus World. This project demonstrates the application of logical representation, logical inference, and reasoning in artificial intelligence. The agent must navigate a 10x10 grid-based cave environment filled with dangers and treasures, using propositional or first-order logic to survive, collect gold, and escape unscathed.

## Features

1. **Environment Representation**  
   - A 10x10 grid representing the Wumpus World.  
   - Support for randomly generated and pre-defined environments.  
   - Configurable placements of the Wumpus, pits, and gold.  

2. **Intelligent Agent**  
   - Navigates the grid using **Propositional** or **First-Order Logic (FOL)**.  
   - Employs **logical inference** techniques, including:  
     - Resolution  
     - Forward chaining  
     - Backward chaining  
   - Includes **probabilistic reasoning** for enhanced decision-making.  

3. **Safety Mechanisms**  
   - Loop detection and avoidance to prevent infinite cycles.  

4. **User Interface**  
   - Visual representation of the environment and agent’s state.  
   - Displays the agent’s knowledge base and thought process in real-time.  

5. **Interactivity and Customization**  
   - Load predefined environments via input files.  
   - Generate random environments for diverse challenges.
